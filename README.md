### Description

Firstly I would like to say Don&#8217;t look over this because its ranked as &#8216;Beginner&#8217; Code, it could be classed as &#8216;Intermediate&#8217; code but I stuck it under beginner as I want people to learn how to make a basic screensaver.

This program is a Screensaver that emulates the &#8216;Blue Screen Of Death&#8217; that users unwillingly get on windows Extra Problems (XP) I made this once as a prank, but decided to turn it into a screensaver, making it just like the real thing, just your able to close it. This code works exactly as a normal screensaver, and shows how to add preview, settings Mouse Hiding etc&#8230;

Enjoy and please leave your comments. Feel free to modify &amp; distribute it; just leave your comments and votes.

Have a nice day with the blue screen of death ;)
